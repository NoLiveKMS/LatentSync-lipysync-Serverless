# LatentSync LipSync – Serverless & Local Deployment

This repository provides a **serverless-ready and local-capable deployment** of **ByteDance’s LatentSync 1.6** lip-sync model.
It supports **explicit environment selection** for **local**, **staging**, and **production** deployments.
This system was ran and tested on **Nvidia RTX 3090 and A40** and consumed **~19 GB video ram**
---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Serverless GPU inference (RunPod compatible)
* Explicit **environment selection** (`local`, `stag`, `prod`)
* Dockerized CUDA environment
* Preloaded models (UNet, Whisper, VAE, InsightFace)
* No runtime model downloads
* Global pipeline reuse
* Clean runtime cleanup & GPU memory handling

## 🔧 Environment Levels (Required)

> **Important:**
> The `level` field is **mandatory** for all runs.

### 🖥️ Local (Development / Debugging)

```json
{
  "level": "local",
  "ref_video_path": "/absolute/path/to/video.mp4",
  "ref_audio_path": "/absolute/path/to/audio.wav"
}
```

* Uses local filesystem
* No cloud credentials required
* Intended for development and debugging only

---

### ☁️ Staging (AWS)

```json
{
  "level": "stag",
  "ref_video_path": "s3://staging-bucket/path/video.mp4",
  "ref_audio_path": "s3://staging-bucket/path/audio.wav"
}
```

* Uses staging AWS resources
* Separate credentials and buckets
* Mirrors production setup safely

---

### 🚀 Production (AWS)

```json
{
  "level": "prod",
  "ref_video_path": "s3://production-bucket/path/video.mp4",
  "ref_audio_path": "s3://production-bucket/path/audio.wav"
}
```

* Uses production AWS infrastructure
* Strict access and IAM policies
* Intended for live workloads

---

## 🧪 Info / Health Check Mode

```json
{
  "aleef": true
}
```

Returns service metadata without running inference.
